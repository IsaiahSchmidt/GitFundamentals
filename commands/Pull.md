# git pull

Similar to [git push](./Push.md), a `git pull` will interact with a remote repository. Only this time it will **pull** the changes down to the local repository

This means any commits made that are o a remote repository will be pulled down and added to the local repository

This can be done by adding the remote name and branch name:
```
git pull origin main
```

If there is any upstream connectionestablished, you cvan use `git pull` without specifying a remote or branch
